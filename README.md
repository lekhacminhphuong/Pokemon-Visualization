## Development
- Utilized D3.js to build interactive Pokemon data visualization.
- There is a Scatter Plot of Sp. Def (x axis) vs Total stats (y axis) and the points are colored according to the Type 1 field. 
- There are two filters: one that controls generation and one that controls legendary pokemon. These can be represented by dropdowns.
- Hovering tooltips shows the pokemon's name, first type and second type (if any).
